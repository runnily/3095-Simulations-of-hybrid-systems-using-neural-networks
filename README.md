# Simulations of hybrid systems using neural networks
Private

This is my dissetetation project at Newcastle Univerity. This project contains a list 
of files/folders used for experiementing how well neural networks can simulate a hybrid system.

The abstract of the dissertation project is as follows:
"Processes that occur in engineering fields and processes that occur in nature 
can be modelled using a dynamical system.  A dynamical system is a system with 
a function based on an ordinary differential equation (ODE). An ODE describes 
the evolution (changes) of a variable through time. Numerical simulations are 
used to approximate the evolution of a variable through time. This project 
proves that given the required training data; neural networks can be used as 
an alternative method to approximate the evolution of a variable through time. 
The training data consists of input-output pairs of samples of state spaces.  
Each state space is derived from a different initial value. The implemented 
neural network takes in an initial value, along with a time sequence to 
predict the corresponding state space. Here, we investigate the neural 
networkâ€™s ability to predict a state space that goes beyond the samples in 
the training data."
